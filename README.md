# JCU Web Framework

The JCU Web Framework is a collection of reusable front-end web components and
examples for use by the University community. Based upon
[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com), this framework makes for faster and easier
web development, and aims to foster consistency between web projects.

To get started, check out
[JCU Web Framework
documentation](https://git.jcu.edu.au/stash/pages/WEBSTYLE/jcu-web-framework/gh-pages/browse/)

### What's included

grouping common assets and providing both compiled and minified variations.
You'll see something like this:

```

│   ├── jcu.css.map
│   ├── jcu.min.css
│   └── jcu.min.css.map

```

We provide compiled CSS and JS (`jcu.*`), as well as compiled and minified
CSS and JS (`jcu.min.*`). CSS [source
maps](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/css-preprocessors)
(`jcu.*.map`) are available for use with certain browsers' developer
tools.

In addition, we provide a variety of imagery for use within pages (such as
backgrounds images, for which there are utility CSS classes available), and
fonts for use in typography and as iconography.

## Versioning

The JCU Web Framework follows Bootstrap's versioning and uses Semantic
Versioning.

> For transparency into our release cycle and in striving to maintain backward
compatibility, Bootstrap is maintained under [the Semantic Versioning
guidelines](http://semver.org/). Sometimes we screw up, but we'll adhere to
those rules whenever possible.

See [the Releases section of our GitHub
project](https://github.com/jcu-eresearch/jcu-web-framework/releases) for changelogs for each
release version.
