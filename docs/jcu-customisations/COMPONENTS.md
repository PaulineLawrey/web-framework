# Components

* Toolbar: the top-level navigation bar that is fixed to the top of all pages.

* Explorer: the heading menu, which allows visitors to interactively examine and
  jump to different areas of the site.

* ``dropdown--open-on-hover``: attach to any given ``.dropdown`` element and its
  dropdown menu will open on over rather than click.  This also absolves the
  element from needing a ``dropdown-toggle`` class and from needing to specify
  any ``data-*`` attributes at all.
